- 👋 Hi, I’m @cpjworks
- 👀 I’m interested in building a social media website / app, a home, and a person.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, GitHub, math, and piano.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful, future-looking projects. More interested in what's next rather than what's now.
- 📫 How to reach me: @cpjworks on GitHub, Instagram, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.
