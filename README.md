- 👋 Hi, I’m **Chris**[^1].
- 👀 I’m interested in building a social media website / app, a home, and a person.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, GitHub, math, and piano.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful, future-looking projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: *@cpjworks* on GitHub, Instagram, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.
- Feel free to say **"Hello"** :)

[^1]: That's not actually me in my profile picture -_-, but if you know where they are from, we can definitely be friends.
