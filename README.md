## 🐻‍❄️ Hi, I’m **Chris**.[^1]
- [x] 🎨 I’m interested in building a social media website / app, a home, and a person.
- [x] 🎒 I’m currently learning Python, GitHub, math, and piano.
- [x] 🏔 I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful, future-looking projects.
- [x] 🚠 You can contact / follow me [@cpjworks](https://linktr.ee/cpjworks) on GitHub, Instagram, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.<br>

Feel free to say **"Hello"** :)

[^1]: That's not actually me in my picture -_-, but if you know who they are, we can definitely be friends.
